# FsAutoComplete

The `FsAutoComplete` project (`FSAC`) provides a backend service for rich editing or 'intellisense' features for editors.

It can be hosted as command-line interface (`stdio` mode) or using the Language Server Protocol (`lsp` mode).

Currently it is used by:

* [Emacs](https://github.com/fsharp/emacs-fsharp-mode)
* [Vim](https://github.com/fsharp/vim-fsharp)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/ionide/ionide-vscode-fsharp)

It's based on:

- [FSharp.Compiler.Service](https://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Compiler.Service/) for F# language info.
- [Dotnet.ProjInfo](https://github.com/enricosada/dotnet-proj-info/) for project/sln management.
- [FSharpLint](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpLint/) for the linter feature.

## Required software

FsAutoComplete can run on .NET/mono or .NET Core.

### FSAC .NET

* on windows: [Microsoft Build Tools 2015](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48159)
* on unix/mac: Required: Mono >= 5.12, Recommended: Mono >= 5.18

### FSAC .NET Core

* .NET Core Sdk
* on unix/mac: Required: Mono >= 5.12, Recommended: Mono >= 5.18

## Building and testing

Requirements:

- .NET Core Sdk, see [global.json](global.json) for the exact version.
- Mono 5.18 on unix/osx
- Microsoft Build Tools 2013

There is a [FAKE script](build.fsx) who can be invoked with `build.cmd`/`build.sh`.

- To build fsautocomplete binaries in `~/bin` directory, do run `build LocalRelease`
- To build, run all tests and create packages, do run `build All`

The [integration tests](test/FsAutoComplete.IntegrationTests) use a simple strategy of running a scripted session with `fsautocomplete` and then comparing the output with that saved in the repository. This requires careful checking when the test is first constructed. On later runs, absolute paths are removed using regular expressions to ensure that the tests are machine-independent.

see [test/FsAutoComplete.IntegrationTests/README.md](test/FsAutoComplete.IntegrationTests/README.md) for more info.


## Communication protocol

### LSP

FsAutoComplete supports [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) as a communication protocol. To start it in LSP mode run `fsautocomplete` binary with `--mode lsp` argument.

#### Supported LSP endpoints

* `initialize`
* `textDocument/didOpen`
* `textDocument/didChange`
* `textDocument/didSave`
* `textDocument/hover`
* `textDocument/completion` & `completionItem/resolve`
* `textDocument/rename`
* `textDocument/definition`
* `textDocument/typeDefinition`
* `textDocument/implementation`
* `textDocument/codeAction`:
  - Remove unused `open`
  - Resolve namespace/module
  - Replace unused symbol with `_`
  - Fix typo based on error message
  - Remove redundant qualifier
  - Add missing `new` keyword for `IDisposable`
  - Generate cases for all DU case in pattern matching
  - Generate empty interface implementation
  - Fixes suggested by [FSharpLint](https://github.com/fsprojects/FSharpLint)
* `textDocument/codeLens` & `codeLens/resolve`:
  - signature Code Lenses

* `textDocument/documentHighlight`
* `textDocument/signatureHelp`
* `textDocument/documentSymbol`
* `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles`
* `workspace/didChangeConfiguration`
* `workspace/symbol`

**Custom endpoints:**

Custom endpoints are using (for messages body) `PlainNotification` type and string format serialized with exactly same serialization format as old JSON protocol

* `fsharp/signature` - accepts `TextDocumentPositionParams`, returns signature of symbol at given position as formated string
* `fsharp/signatureData` - accepts `TextDocumentPositionParams`, returns signature of symbol at given position as DTO
* `fsharp/lineLens` - accepts `ProjectParms` (`Project` filed contain F# file path), returns locations where LineLenses should be displayed
* `fsharp/compilerLocation` - no input, returns paths to FCS, FSI and MsBuild
* `fsharp/compile` - accepts `ProjectParms`, tries to compile project, returns list of errors and exit status code
* `fsharp/workspacePeek` - accepts `WorkspacePeekRequest`, returns list of possible workspaces (resolved solution files, or list of projects if there are no solution files)
* `fsharp/workspaceLoad` - accepts `WorkspaceLoadParms`, loads given list of projects in the background, partial result notified by `fsharp/notifyWorkspace` notification
* `fsharp/project` - accepts `ProjectParms`, loads given project
* `fsharp/fsdn` - accepts `ProjectParms` (`Project` filed contain query string), query FSDN and returns list of functions
* `fsharp/f1Help` - accepts `TextDocumentPositionParams`, returns URL to MSDN documentation for symbol at given position
* `fsharp/documentation` - accepts `TextDocumentPositionParams`, returns documentation data about symbol at given position, used for InfoPanel
* `fsharp/documentationSymbol` - accepts `DocumentationForSymbolReuqest`, returns documentation data about given symbol from given assembly, used for InfoPanel

#### Supported LSP notifications

* `window/showMessage`
* `window/logMessage`
* `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`

**Custom notifications:**

* `fsharp/notifyWorkspace` - notification for workspace/solution/project loading events
* `fsharp/notifyWorkspacePeek` - notification for initial workspace peek

#### Additional startup options:

* `--background-service-enabled` - passing this flag enables background service feature, increasing FSAC responsiveness by moving some of the operations (especially background type checking) to other process. It results in increased memory usage. Used by default in Ionide.
* `--verbose` - passing this flag enables additional logging being printed out in `stderr`
* `DOTNET_ROOT` - setting this environment variable will set the dotnet SDK root, which is used when finding references for FSX scripts.

#### Initialization options:

Options that should be send as `initializationOptions` as part of `initialize` request.

* `AutomaticWorkspaceInit` - setting it to `true` will start Workspace Loading without need to run `fsharp/workspacePeek` and `fsharp/workspaceLoad` commands. It will always choose top workspace from the found list - all projects in workspace if 0 `.sln` files are found, `.sln` file if 1 `.sln` file was found, `.sln` file with most projects if multiple `.sln` files were found. It's designed to be used in clients that doesn't allow to create custom UI for selecting workspaces.

#### Settings:

* `FSharp.keywordsAutocomplete` - provides keywords in autocomplete list, recommended default value: `true`
* `FSharp.ExternalAutocomplete` - provides autocomplete for symbols from not opened namespaces/modules, insert `open` on accept, recommended default value: `false`

### Old stdio protocol

It is expected that the editor will launch this program in the background and communicate over a pipe. It is possible to use interactively, although due to the lack of any readline support it isn't pleasant, and text pasted into the buffer may not be echoed. As a result, use this only for very simple debugging. For more complex scenarios it is better to write another integration test by copying an [existing one](test/FsAutoComplete.IntegrationTests/Test1Json).

The available commands can be listed by running `fsautocomplete --commands`. Commands are all on a single line, with the exception of the `parse` command, which should be followed by the current text of the file to parse (which may differ from the contents on disk), and terminated with a line containing only `<<EOF>>`.

Data is returned as JSON. An example of a simple session is:

```
project "Test1.fsproj"
```

```json
{"Kind":"project","Data":{"Files":["<absolute path removed>/Program.fs"],"Output":"<absolute path removed>/bin/Debug/Test1.exe"}}
```

```
parse "Program.fs"
module X =
    let func x = x + 1

    let val2 = X.func 2
    <<EOF>>
```

```json
{"Kind":"INFO","Data":"Background parsing started"}
```

```json
completion "Program.fs" 4 13
```

```json
{"Kind":"completion","Data":["func"]}
```

Each response is exactly one line, which simplifies the application of a JSON parser. For further insight into the communication protocol, have a look over the integration tests, which have examples of all the features. Each folder contains one or more `*Runner.fsx` files which specify a sequence of commands to send, and `*.json` files, which contain the output.

## Troubleshooting

### FileWatcher exceptions

You may see a stack trace finishing with `System.IO.IOException: kqueue() error at init, error code = ’0’`. This is due to a limitation in the number of filehandles that the Mono file watchers can keep open. Restarting FsAutoComplete or the hosting editor should help. If not, try setting `export MONO_MANAGED_WATCHER=disabled` in your `~/.bash_profile`. Note that on OSX, this setting will only take effect if you launch emacs from the terminal.
